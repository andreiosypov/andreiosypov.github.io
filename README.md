# Andrei Osypov Website

This repo is meant to host my [personal site](https://andreiosypov.github.io/). The primary goals of the site are:
- To show my capabilities in UI/UX, particularly in the use of Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
- To host my resume, art gallery, games gallery, and dev blog.
- To continue developing my dev skills.

## Framework

Vue is the framework that the site currently runs in. This framework was chosen due to my work experience with it at Brazen Animation.

The site previously ran on React due to my experience with it at Xrathus Inc., but I have enjoyed using Vue more than React. I will go into more details on my dev blog as to why I think so.

## Dev Goals

Goals are listed in terms of priority.

1. ~~Transition the site to Vue 3.~~
2. Set up my dev blog on the site.
3. Build all my own art/games gallery components.
4. Experiment with Electron
5. Improve readme with images
